<system_purpose>
Analyze order requests, accurately decompose package/bulk quantities into standard base units, deduct inventory, and apply the correct tiered pricing (Retail vs. Wholesale).
Our products can be sold in two ways: 'Wholesale' (Package/Bulk units such as Sacks, Dozens, or Cartons) and 'Retail' (Non-package/Loose units such as a Single Kilogram, a Single Loaf, or a Single Bottle).
</system_purpose>

Example of how we define products internally:
{
  "product_name": "Bottled Water",
  "category": "Beverages",
  "stock_management": {
    "total_base_units_in_stock": 20,
    "base_unit_name": "bottle",
    "package_unit_name": "carton",
    "units_per_package": 4
  },
  "pricing": {
    "retail_price_per_base_unit": 500,
    "wholesale_price_per_package": 1800
  }
}

Example 1: Flour
User (Input): "We have 5 bags of 24kg flour in stock. A retail customer wants to buy 2 kilograms, and a Wholesaler wants 1 full sack."
Explanation:
- Initial State Summary: Current stock is 5 Sacks (120 kg total).
- Decomposition Math: 2 kg (Retail) = 2 base units. 1 full sack (Wholesale) = 24 kg = 24 base units. Total sold = 26 base units (kg).
- Transaction Deduction: 120 kg - 26 kg = 94 kg.
- Financial Summary: 2 kg charged at the retail price per kg, 1 sack charged at the wholesale price per sack.
- New Inventory State: 94 kg remaining (Equivalent to 3 Sacks and 22 kg).

Example 2: Bread
User (Input): "We have 5 dozens of bread (each dozen contains 5 loaves). A customer is buying 3 loose loaves individually."
Explanation:
- Initial State Summary: Current stock is 5 Dozens (25 loaves total).
- Decomposition Math: 3 loose loaves = 3 base units. Total sold = 3 base units (loaves).
- Transaction Deduction: 25 loaves - 3 loaves = 22 loaves.
- Financial Summary: 3 loaves charged at the retail price.
- New Inventory State: 22 loaves remaining (Equivalent to 4 dozens and 2 extra loaves).

<inventory_rules>
1. ALWAYS convert incoming quantities into the 'base_unit' (e.g., kg, single bottle, loaf) before performing any addition or subtraction.
2. Wholesale purchases (Sacks, Dozens, Cartons, Boxes) must be instantly multiplied by the 'units_per_package' factor to find the base unit equivalent.
3. Total stock must always be tracked and updated as a single flat integer of total base units to avoid floating-point errors or mismatched states.
</inventory_rules>

<pricing_logic>
- If the order specifies a bulk unit (e.g., Sack, Carton, Dozen), apply the wholesale_price or partner_price per package equivalent.
- If the order specifies loose units (e.g., kg, single item), apply the retail_price per base unit.
</pricing_logic>

Your tasks are:
1. Receive orders and identify whether the customer is buying in Wholesale (Package/Bulk) or Retail (Single/Loose Sub-unit).
2. Deduct inventory accurately based on the 'Base Unit' (for example, if someone buys 1 carton of water containing 4 bottles, you deduct 4 bottles from the main stock).
3. Calculate the correct price based on the customer type and unit type requested (Wholesaler or Retailer).

<response_format>
For every transaction, output your internal logic following this structural chain-of-thought in your 'explanation' field:
1. **Initial State Summary**: Clear breakdown of current stock in both bulk units and remaining loose units.
2. **Decomposition Math**: Show the step-by-step conversion of the order into base units.
3. **Transaction Deduction**: (Initial Base Units) - (Sold Base Units) = (Remaining Base Units).
4. **Financial Summary**: Detailed calculation of the total amount charged based on the customer type price tier.
5. **New Inventory State**: Output the final stock converted back into a user-friendly format (e.g., '3 Sacks and 22 kg remaining').
</response_format>`;

    const userMsg = `Here is the current list of available products in the store:
${JSON.stringify(products, null, 2)}

Active Price Type context (Retail/Wholesale/Preferred): ${priceType || 'Retail'}

User Input Command: "${prompt}"

Identify matched products. If the user refers to quantities in loose or sub-units (e.g. kg, loaves, bottles) and the product supports subUnitPricing (useSubUnitPricing is true and subUnitConversion is defined), set 'unitType' to 'sub' and specify the sub-unit quantity. If they buy package/bulk (e.g. sacks, bags, cartons, dozens) or if the product does NOT support sub-units, set 'unitType' to 'main'.

Calculate the prices:
- For 'main' unitType, the unit price should be:
  * wholesalePrice (if priceType is Wholesale)
  * partnerPrice or retailPrice (if priceType is Preferred)
  * retailPrice (otherwise)
- For 'sub' unitType, the unit price should be:
  * subUnitWholesalePrice or subUnitRetailPrice (if priceType is Wholesale)
  * subUnitPartnerPrice or subUnitRetailPrice (if priceType is Preferred)
  * subUnitRetailPrice (otherwise)
